## Project 3: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This project dives into the domain of Computer Vision. I built a model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images.

* **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Final Accuracy on Test Set:** 97.04%

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **Computer Vision:** Working with image pixel data.
* **Data Preparation:** Reshaping and normalizing image data for a machine learning model.
* **Multi-Class Classification:** Building a model to predict one of ten possible categories.

### Interactive Demo & Deployment
To complete the project lifecycle, I deployed the trained neural network as an interactive web application using **Gradio**. This app allows a user to draw a digit on a sketchpad and see the model's prediction in real-time.
